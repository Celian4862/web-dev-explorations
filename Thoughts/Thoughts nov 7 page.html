                <p>So, I was listening to this audio about the 80/20 rule, which is basically about putting in twenty percent of your efforts to get eighty percent of your results. Later in the audio, I heard the narrator say that you shouldn't be good at many things, but you should instead just focus on one thing to master. Previously, I thought that it was better to be good at many things in order to be self-sufficient. This made me question: "Is it truly better to be an expert at one thing or be decent in many things?</p>
                <p> And so my research began. Though the internet isn't particularly helpful due to its abundance of supposedly relevant but actually irrelevant results, I managed to find a few articles that talk about this issue of mine. From what I understand from these articles, both mastering one skill and being decent at many are equally important. Here's why.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Innovation and creativity require knowledge of more than one field. you need to combine different things to create new things.</li>
                    <li> Although it's not bad to master one skill, it's beneficial to know a bit of other skills, such as cooking. If you have to go and eat out every time, you may not be able to choose what you'll eat.</li>
                    <li> You could be well-known for your skills if you are extraordinary in such a skill. But if you are good in only that skill and not at least decent in some basic ones, people may no longer find you so impressive.</li>
                    <li> You can also try moving on to master another skill if you feel confident in your first skill. Don't forget to continually practice your skills.</li>
