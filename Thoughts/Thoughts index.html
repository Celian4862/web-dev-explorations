                <p>Welcome to this website, dear reader. This website doesn't have a particular name, but it's going to contain certain things I have in mind. Usually questions.</p>
                <p>You see, I'm a very curious person. I tend to ask a lot of questions, even ones that seem so obvious. Even imperative statements get questions. Just for the clarification.</p>
                <p>And I research. On the internet, of course. As of today, 19:51, 11/8/2021, Monday, there is still a pandemic from a coronavirus generally known as COVID-19. We don't know if it will ever end. I hope it ends soon. But apparently, the natural environment of the Earth was drastically restored due to several sudden lockdowns in various countries. That might not last long.</p>
